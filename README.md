# graphy
Boilerplate GraphView Android App. 

I made this to quickly show a friend on how to use graphview in their app. Feel free to use it for your own projects.

# how to use it
Simply download it and open it in Android Studio. It should be good to go and you can use it for your own projects. I would recommend checking out the main library's wiki page on how to implement certain functionality.
